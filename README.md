# Python-Challenge

Analysis of PyBank and PyPoll csv files


In this python challenge we will be using tools we have gone over in class this past week. There are three different challenges in this homeworls assignment. 

Challenge 1: This challenge will be on familiarizing myself with using the repositories and manuevering through the files via the command line. Create all folders and files necessary to complete challenge 2 and 3 along with creating commits, pushes, and pulls via a terminal.


Challenge 2: Will be analysing financial data in a csv file. We will need to be able to read the file so that we then can find: Total number of months, Net total amount of profit/lossess, average of the changes in profit/loss, greatest increase in profits, greatest decrease in losses.


Challenge 3: Includes analyzing data from a county election via a csv file. Find: total number of votes cast, complete list of candidates who recieved votes, total votes for each candidate, percent of votes for each candidate, and the overall popular vote winner of election.
